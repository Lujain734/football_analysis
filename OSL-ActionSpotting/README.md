OSL-ActionSpotting is a plug-and-play library that unifies action
spotting algorithms.

## ü•≥ What's New

- A technical report of this library will be provided soon.

## üìñ Major Features

- **Support SoTA TAD methods with modular design.** We decompose the TAD pipeline into different components, and implement them in a modular way. This design makes it easy to implement new methods and reproduce existing methods.
- **Support multiple datasets.** We support new datasets by giving a intermediate JSON format.
- **Support feature-based training and end-to-end training.** The feature-based training can easily be extended to end-to-end training with raw video input, and the video backbone can be easily replaced.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation and data preparation.

## üöÄ Usage

Please refer to [usage.md](docs/usage.md) for details of training and evaluation scripts.

_Note: - We have added few documentation guides inside different parts of the library to make working with the library easier. Like this is an [instruction](configs/_base_/datasets/json/README.md) for class intialization inside the configs directory. So please try to follow them if you get issues while working with the library. :)_

## ü§ù Roadmap

All the things that need to be done in the future is in [roadmap.md](docs/en/roadmap.md).
